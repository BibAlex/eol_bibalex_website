# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  scientific_name_description: "      Scientists aim to describe a single 'tree of life' that reflects the evolutionary relationships of living things. 
      However, evolutionary relationships are a matter of ongoing discovery, and there are different opinions about how living 
      things should be grouped and named. EOL reflects these differences by supporting several different scientific 'classifications'.
      Some species have been named more than once. Such duplicates are listed under synonyms.
      EOL also provides support for common names which may vary across regions as well as languages."
